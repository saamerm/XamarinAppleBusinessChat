# Xamarin iOS implementation of Apple Business Chat

This repository contain the code needed to implement the Apple Business Chat in your application. 
You will notice in this repository, that there are two different ways for implementing the chat

1. BCChatButton - Apple's recommended way of initiating chat from within the app
2. URL Link - A hacky way I figured, that you can use to launch the chat through anywhere in the app
